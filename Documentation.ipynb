    "# #1: Identifying and Defining\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "    I am looking to analyse the data of YouTube videos, including performance data (likes, dislikes, views etc.) and categorical data (video topic, location data, channel category etc.)\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "    The goal of this analysis will be to create a program that can take an input of, for example, a country, and display videos according to a rule, for example, top 100 performing videos. This program would also have the ability to display data of YouTube Shorts seperately, with the functionality to perform actions such as filtering out remixed videos.\n",
    "## Source\n",
    "    https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3\n",
    "## Access\n",
    "    This data is publicly available, courtesy of Google Developers, however, this API has a limit on the amount of requested units per day.\n",
    "## Access Method\n",
    "    I will access this data using the YouTube Data API, which provides all of the data needed.  \n",
    "## Functional Requirements & Use Cases\n",
    "-   Data Loading\n",
    "    -   The program should load data as a .txt file of what the API supplies for a request. Errors in this method, such as an error in requesting this information, should be communicated to the user and noted for future fixes.\n",
    "    -   The user will input the data they want to request through the GUI.\n",
    "    -   The program will output a .txt file of this data to be used for the next steps.\n",
    "    -   ***Use Case***  \n",
    "        **Actor**: User  \n",
    "        **Goal**: To load a dataset into the system.  \n",
    "        **Preconditions**: User has a dataset file ready.  \n",
    "        **Main Flow**:  \n",

    "        System loads the dataset and displays the information in a dataframe.  \n",
    "        Postconditions: Dataset is loaded and ready for analysis.  \n",
    "-   Data Cleaning\n",
    "    -   The system need to handle issues such as videos or channels that have been privated, as well as needing to filter out things like remixed YouTube Shorts or certain genres of videos depending on user input.\n",
    "    -   The user will input their filters of choice into the GUI (e.g. filter out remixes of Shorts).\n",
    "    -   The program will output data as usual, but with the unwanted results omitted.\n",

    "-   Data Analysis\n",
    "    -   The program needs to allow for mean and mode analyses for functions such as average views per day and most popular video in a locale respectively.\n",
    "    -   The user will input the value they would like through the GUI (e.g. most popular video in a locale).\n",
    "    -   The program will output the desired value.\n",

    "    -   The user will input data wanted (e.g. views over last month).\n",
    "    -   The program will output the appropriate visualisation (e.g. line graph of views over time).\n",

    "    -   The system should include the output of only the requested data, which will be stored in a temporary .csv file that will be available to download for permanent use.\n",

    "-   Usability\n",
    "    -   The program needs to have an easy to read and understandable GUI, which allows the user to request all data they want, as well as a README document that tells the user how to use the program.\n",
