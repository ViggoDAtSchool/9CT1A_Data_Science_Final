    "    I am looking to analyse the data of YouTube videos, including performance data (likes, dislikes, views etc.) and categorical data (video topic, location data, channel category etc.)\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "    The goal of this analysis will be to create a program that can take an input of, for example, a country, and display videos according to a rule, for example, top 100 performing videos. This program would also have the ability to display data of YouTube Shorts seperately, with the functionality to perform actions such as filtering out remixed videos.\n",

    "    This data is publicly available, courtesy of Google Developers, however, this API has a limit on the amount of requested units per day.\n",
    "## Access Method\n",
    "    I will access this data using the YouTube Data API, which provides all of the data needed."
